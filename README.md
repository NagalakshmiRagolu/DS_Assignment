📊 Data Science Assignment – NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn

This project demonstrates fundamental operations in Python’s data science ecosystem using four core libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🔢 NumPy (Numerical Python)

NumPy is used for numerical computation and handling multi-dimensional arrays.

✅ Operations Used in This Assignment:

Array Creation

arange, linspace, array, ones, eye, tile – Create sequences, matrices, and repeated arrays.

Mathematical Operations

sum, mean, std, sqrt, cumsum, unique – Perform statistics, cumulative sums, and root calculations.

Linear Algebra

dot, matmul, cross, linalg – Matrix multiplication, vector cross products, and solving equations.

Array Manipulation

reshape, hstack, vstack, flip, pad, where, diag – Reshape arrays, stack them, pad with values, reverse, and conditionally select.

Random Numbers

random – Generate random integers, floats, and distributions.

Handling Missing Data

nan – Representation of missing values.

🔎 Purpose: NumPy is the foundation for mathematical computation in Python and is essential for efficient data handling.

🐼 Pandas

Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation with Series (1D) and DataFrames (2D).

✅ Operations Used in This Assignment:

Data Structures

Series, DataFrame, MultiIndex – Represent labeled data in 1D, 2D, and hierarchical indexing.

Data Import & Cleaning

read_csv, to_datetime, to_numeric – Load datasets, convert columns to datetime or numeric types.

Data Transformation

concat, merge, cut – Combine datasets, merge on keys, and categorize data into bins.

Data Aggregation & Reshaping

pivot_table – Create pivot tables for grouped analysis.

Date Handling

date_range – Generate sequences of dates for time series analysis.

🔎 Purpose: Pandas makes it easier to clean, reshape, and analyze structured data.

📈 Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a visualization library for creating plots and charts.

✅ Visualizations Used in This Assignment:

Basic Plotting

plot, hist, subplot – Create line plots, histograms, and multiple plots in one figure.

Figure Formatting

figure, suptitle, tight_layout – Adjust figure size, titles, and layout.

Labels & Legends

title, xlabel, ylabel, legend – Add titles, axis labels, and legends.

Display

show – Render plots.

🔎 Purpose: Matplotlib helps to visualize patterns, distributions, and relationships in the dataset.

🌈 Seaborn

Seaborn is a statistical visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

✅ Visualizations Used in This Assignment:

Statistical Plots

boxplot – Display distribution, median, and outliers.

heatmap – Show correlations and data intensity in grid form.

pairplot – Display pairwise relationships between variables.

🔎 Purpose: Seaborn makes it easy to create aesthetically pleasing and statistical plots for deeper insights.

📝 Overall Note (Short)

This assignment demonstrates end-to-end data operations:

NumPy for array computations

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for basic plotting

Seaborn for advanced visualization

These four libraries form the core toolkit for every data scientist to analyze and visualize data effectively.
